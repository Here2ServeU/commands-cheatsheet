# Git Command Reference Guide

A handy guide to essential Git commands for efficient version control and collaboration.

## Basic Commands
1. **`git status`**: Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area, showing which changes are staged, unstaged, or untracked.
2. **`git diff`**: Compares changes in your working directory against the last commit to highlight differences that are not yet staged.
3. **`git add <file_path>`**: Prepares specific files for the next commit by adding them to the staging area.
4. **`git commit -a -m "commit message"`**: Automatically stages all modified tracked files and commits them with a message.
5. **`git commit --amend`**: Modifies the most recent commit by combining it with new changes or editing its message.

## Branching and Merging
6. **`git branch`**: Lists all local branches in the repository.
7. **`git branch -D <branch_name>`**: Forcefully deletes a branch, even if it has unmerged changes.
8. **`git branch --set-upstream-to <remote_branch>`**: Links a local branch to a specified remote branch for tracking.
9. **`git checkout -b <branch_name>`**: Creates a new branch and switches to it immediately.
10. **`git checkout <branch_name>`**: Changes the working directory to an existing branch.
11. **`git merge <branch_name>`**: Integrates changes from another branch into the current branch.

## Working with Remote Repositories
12. **`git clone <repository_url>`**: Downloads a copy of a remote repository to your local machine.
13. **`git push origin <branch_name>`**: Uploads local commits from the specified branch to the remote repository.
14. **`git pull`**: Fetches updates from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
15. **`git fetch`**: Downloads new data from the remote repository without affecting your working branch.

---

## Undoing Changes
16. **`git reset`**: Moves the HEAD pointer to a specified commit, allowing you to undo commits.
17. **`git reset HEAD~1`**: Reverts the last commit but retains the changes in your working directory.
18. **`git reset --soft HEAD^`**: Rolls back the last commit while keeping its changes staged for another commit.
19. **`git reset --hard <commit>`**: Completely reverts to a specific commit, erasing all subsequent changes.
20. **`git revert <commit_id>`**: Creates a new commit that reverses the changes introduced in a specific commit.

---

## Rewriting History
21. **`git rebase <branch_name>`**: Reapplies commits from the current branch onto the specified branch for a cleaner history.
22. **`git rebase -i`**: Allows interactive editing of commit history, enabling squashing, reordering, or editing commits.
23. **`git cherry-pick <commit_id>`**: Copies changes from a specific commit into the current branch.

---

## Stashing Changes
24. **`git stash`**: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes to a stack, allowing you to work on something else.
25. **`git stash pop`**: Restores the last stashed changes and removes them from the stash.

---

## Viewing History and Details
26. **`git log --stat`**: Displays the commit history along with a summary of changes for each commit.
27. **`git show <commit_id>`**: Provides detailed information about a specific commit, including changes and metadata.

---

## Advanced Operations
28. **`git checkout <commit>`**: Moves the working directory to the state of a specific commit, enabling exploration of previous versions.
29. **`git reset --soft HEAD^`**: Unwinds the last commit but keeps its changes staged for re-commit.
30. **`git reset --hard HEAD~1`**: Completely discards the latest commit and any uncommitted changes, resetting the branch to a clean state.
